## v0.4.0 Release Cycle: CLOSED

Release shipped 2026-05-21. PR #4 (`release/v0.4.0-prep` →
`main`) merged at `aadde89`; v0.4.0 annotated tag pushed
(`aadde89`); GitHub Release published as **Latest** at
https://github.com/slam0504/go-ddd-core/releases/tag/v0.4.0.
Branch `release/v0.4.0-prep` deleted local + remote.

Shipped scope:

- `D eventbus/inbox/memory.go` (was 116 lines)
- `D eventbus/inbox/memory_test.go` (was 129 lines)
- `M CHANGELOG.md` — `[0.4.0] - 2026-05-20` section with
  `### Removed (BREAKING)` entry and migration snippet
- `M docs/anti-patterns.md` — Substitute section now points at
  adapters unambiguously; previous "Note on
  `eventbus/inbox/memory.go`" callout rewritten as past-tense
  "Historical note: the v0.4.0 `eventbus/inbox` removal"
- `A .agent/`, `A AGENTS.md`, `A CLAUDE.md` (in a separate
  `chore(agent)` commit on `main` ahead of the release PR) —
  agent protocol files brought into version control with
  paths normalised to repo-relative

Verification on `main` @ `aadde89`:

- `gofmt -l .` clean
- `go vet ./...` clean
- `go build ./...` clean
- `go test ./...` PASS (all packages, including the `eventbus`
  contract tests — the `Inbox` interface in `eventbus/inbox.go`
  was never under the deleted sub-package)

The `v0.4.0` tag is on proxy.golang.org once `go get` fetches
it. Treat it as a permanent published version.

Call sites stay identical — only the import path changes:

- before: `github.com/slam0504/go-ddd-core/eventbus/inbox`
- after:  `github.com/slam0504/go-ddd-adapters/eventbus/inbox`

Secondary items (accumulate in core `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]`):

- TBD; revisit `docs/anti-patterns.md` "Design boundaries" section to
  see if any documented gap has shifted to "should be addressed".

## Open Items

- ~~**v0.4.0 deletion gating**~~ ✅ resolved 2026-05-20 (both
  gates closed) and shipped 2026-05-21:
  1. Downstream consumer migration — `consumer inventory = []`
     (personal repo, no external consumers).
  2. Adapters past v0.3.0 — `v0.4.0` annotated tag `bc9b041`
     burned the "one more release cycle" overlap window.

  The same gating framework still applies if this repo ever
  gains external consumers — record any new consumer in
  cross-repo memory before a future breaking removal.

## Verification (post-cycle)

- core `main` @ `aadde89`: `go test ./...` last passed 2026-05-21
  pre-tag (post-merge tip); `gofmt -l .`, `go vet ./...`,
  `go build ./...` also clean.
- adapters `main` @ `d438c0a`: `go test ./...` last passed during
  the v0.4.0 cycle (both modules, plus `go vet -tags=integration`).
